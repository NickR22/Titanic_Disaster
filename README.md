The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew on board, only 712 survived. The disaster was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, and it led to significant improvements in maritime safety regulations, including the requirement for ships to carry enough lifeboats for all passengers and crew.
